# üñ• XCSDemo 

This is a sample application which main purpose is show how you can easily use [**XcodeServerSDK**](https://github.com/czechboy0/XcodeServerSDK) and create _almost_ everything based on **Xcode Server**! üëç
I'm a huge Swift fan, so this one is written in Swift 2, so be sure you use at least Xcode 7.0 to run this code.

# üõ† Install

The only dependency used in this project is **XcodeServerSDK** itself, but it's installed using [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org), so be sure to run proper command before you start with this project:
```shell
pod install
```

After the whole `install` process finishes with success you can open `XCSDemo.xcworkspace` and get your hands dirty with this little project!
